# Stock-Price-Prediction

Stock Price Prediction Web App is a comprehensive Python-based application that empowers users to forecast future stock prices using a feed-forward neural network trained on historical market data. The application automates data retrieval from Yahoo Finance via the `yfinance` library, cleans and normalizes time-series data with Pandas and NumPy, and segments it into sliding windows for training. Leveraging TensorFlow Keras, it constructs and trains a multi-layer neural network, achieving approximately 10% better forecast accuracy compared to a 30-day moving-average baseline. An interactive Flask-powered dashboard visualizes actual versus predicted prices in real time, complete with performance metrics such as MAE, MSE, and RMSE. Built with modularity and scalability in mind, this project demonstrates end-to-end development of an AI-driven financial forecasting tool.
